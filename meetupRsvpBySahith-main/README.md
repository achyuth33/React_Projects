# ðŸ“±Meetup RSVP App

You have an upcoming JS meetup where you need the participants to RSVP so that you can prepare appropriate accommodations and transport facilities. The participants can bring up to two guests along with them.

You also need an admin screen that contains list of all the participants which can be searched based on their names and locality

The task is to build three screens in a `DrawerNavigator`.

### First Screen

It will have a registration form with following fields â€”

- 1. Name
- 2. Age
- 3. D.O.B (JS `Date` object)
- 4. Profession (can be `Employed`/`Student`)
- 5. Locality
- 6. Number of Guests (0-2)
- 7. Address (multiline input upto 50 characters)

With a submit button you can simply mock a submit API call with services like [Beeceptor](<[https://beeceptor.com/](https://beeceptor.com/)>). Also ensure you show an alert to the user if they click back while editing the form.

## Second Screen

Second screen in the drawer should have a searchable list of all the RSVP'd users (JSON data can be mocked using a tool like [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com/)). The list can have the name and locality of the RSVPâ€™d user. The entire list should be searchable with a single text input by the userâ€™s locality and name. Clicking an user in the list will open a new screen that contains all the details collected in the first form.

### Third Screen

The third screen will have useful reports regarding the event. The reports you'll need to build are â€”

1. Number of people in a given age range (`13-18`, `18-25` and `25+`).
2. Number of people by localities.
3. Average group size of people attending the event (using guests count).
4. Professionals & students count.

You can use either React Native or Expo to build the app.
